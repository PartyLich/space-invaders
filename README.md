## Space Invaders

Rewrite of a simple Space Invaders clone which demonstrates an animation loop,
collision detection, keyboard input, drawing to the canvas and playing sounds.

This version uses **e**ntities, **c**omponents, and **s**ystems to accomplish the same result.
This readme was updated nearly 2 years after the rewrite. I don't entirely remember
writing the code at all, but I *assume* I did so do improve my understanding of ECS.

# Annotated code

This was forked and rewritten from one of the samples in 'Annotated Code' by
Mary Rose Cook.
